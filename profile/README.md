# Operating System Images based on Fedora Silverblue

This is a collection of container images using Fedora's [support for OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery mechanism for operating system content. ](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable). In short, we generate images here to build your perfect desktop. The original mission was to build an Ubuntu-like experience for Silverblue, however containers have changed the game, making customization trivial.

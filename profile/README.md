## Custom Operating System images based on Fedora

This is a collection of container images using Fedora's [support for OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery mechanism for operating system content](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable). This project's purpose is to be a "kit" for you to derive from to create your perfect image as well as provide high quality images for use as a desktop.
